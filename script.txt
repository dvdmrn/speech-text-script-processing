© [14 (I’m going to try to find a better looking actual PDF but if not please try to make it look as PDFy as possible)] A recent population study on acne, © [g] reported a statistically significant relationship between acne severity and dietary factors such as chocolate and dairy products, © [URL 41 ACNE a. Does chocolate cause acne] both of which…. © [URL https://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/] I have videos about…. © [back to 14g then expand] But this surprised me: sunflower seed consumption.

When I think sunflower seeds I just think © [3] good whole food source of nutrition © [g] found to lower cholesterol levels as much almonds, which is pretty good. There are however right and wrong ways to eat them. © [7gq] If you sit down and eat a pound of unshelled sunflower seeds. Just eat them with the shell still on, © [7 gunderline] you can end up corked, with a fist- sized mass of shredded sunflower seed shells. How qould a doctor diagnose such a thing? © [5] By the “colonic crunch” sign, of course. Sounds like breakfast cereal served in hell. But © [y] rather it’s when you palpate a large crunchy rectal mass. © [11F1a] I’ve got a picture for you, of course 

© [9gq] Can end up a sharp, thorny mass, which is why the so-called sunflower seed syndrome © [10] has been described as a prickly proctological problem, © [g] lamenting that people who consume health foods occasionally fall into the trap of believing "if some is good, more is better." It’s not the amount, though, it’s how they’re eating them, with the shells still on. © [6gq] That’s why the syndrome is uncommon unless the patients are children who don’t know any better or adults who are either impaired or, have no experience with eating sunflower seeds. 

© [8gq] Most cases involve younger children, but here researchers describe a psychologically sound 13 year old, © [expand] stressing the importance of the role of the parents to guide their children about the potential problems associated with the ingestion of too many unshelled seeds. 

© [4] You can overdo even shelled seeds, though. © [g] Because of just the nature of sunflowers, they’re good at drawing the naturally occurring heavy metal cadmium out of the ground, so end up with higher levels than most foods even if grown in uncontaminated soils. © [yunderline] Though people who consume large amounts of sunflower seeds don't seem to suffer any untoward effects or even end up with detectably higher cadmium levels, here they defined large amounts as greater than an ounce a week, which is like a handful, about 150 seeds.
