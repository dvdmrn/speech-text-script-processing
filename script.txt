© [10gq] Too much cholesterol in the blood has long been considered to act as the primary risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease and, possibly, Parkinson’s disease. © [37f2Aq] I’ve shown these striking images of what the brain arteries of Alzheimer’s victims  look like on autopsy, clogged with fat and cholesterol © [expand to include blue] compared to nondemented elderly controls. © [100g] But wait a second, cholesterol cannot be directly exported across the blood-brain barrier so it can’t directly get into the brain or out of the brain. What if the brain has too much cholesterol and needs to get rid of some. As a safety valve © [expand] an enzyme in the brain oxidizes the cholesterol and in this form an exit the brain and eventually the body. © [back to 10g then y] Ah, but here’s the kicker: although this fact means that the brain can eliminate excess amounts of these oxidation products, it could conversely allow toxic amounts of oxysterols—oxidized cholesterol—present in the blood stream, to accumulate in the brain 

© [6] This is not just a theoretical concern. © [g] This elegant study showed that by measuring oxidized cholesterol levels in the blood coming off the brain measured in the jugular vein in the neck, © [y] the levels of oxidized cholesterol was higher in the arterial blood going up to the brain. © [b] This shows if you have too much oxidized cholesterol in your bloodstream it can end up in your brain. © [7yq] This is a problem, because the accumulation of oxysterols cytotoxic, mutagenic, atherogenic and possible carcinogenic—in other words toxic to cells, toxic to DNA, and contributing to heart disease and maybe cancer. © [8gq] Yes, samples from atherosclerotic plaques on autopsy contain 20 times more cholesterol than normal arteries, but they contain 45 times higher levels of oxidized cholesterol. 

© [9b] Cholesterol oxidation products may be up to a hundred times more pathological, more toxic than unoxidized cholesterol. © [5f1] Contributing to not only heart disease but potentially a variety of different major chronic diseases, including Alzheimer’s. OK, so how can we cut down on the amount of these oxysterols in our blood? © [7g  no q just citation bar] One way is by not eating them. Oxidized cholesterol is found in milk powders, meat and meat products (including fish), cheese, eggs and egg products.

© [18uq] Until recently, our understanding has been limited by the lack of testing methods procedures to accurately analyze the amount found in various foods © [9t1  no q just citation bar] until, now. Found throughout animal products. © [circle “119.9”] Canned tuna was surprisingly high, but © [circle “259.0”] ghee takes the cake. 

© [18gq] Ghee, clarified butter, boiled butter, is commonly used in Indian cooking. The method of preparation appears to multiply oxidized cholesterol levels tenfold. © [29redq] This dietary exposure from oxidized in cholesterol may help explain why they subcontinent of India is ravaged by such heart disease even though a significant proportion of the population stays away from meat and eggs. © [30gq] A number of Indian dairy-based desserts are also made in a similar way.

© [14] Oxidized cholesterol in the diet is a source of oxidized cholesterol in the human bloodstream, © [43g] where it can then readily cross the blood brain barrier into the brain, © [y] and this could trigger inflammation in the brain, the buildup of amyloid, all occurring years before the impairment of memory is diagnosed. © [13] These early studies showing the buildup of oxidized cholesterol in the blood of those fed meals rich in oxidized cholesterol, © [13f4] where you get this spike in your bloodstream a few hours after you eat, were done with things like © [circle  “powdered egg "] powdered egg, which can be found in a lot of processed foods but you typically don’t sit down to a meal of it. © [12] You get the same thing from eating normal food too, though. © [g] Give some folks some salami and Parmesan-cheese, which are naturally rich in cholesterol oxidation products, © [f1] and later that days it’s circulating throughout their bodies.

© [35gq] And higher levels are not only associated with mild cognitive impairment. © [39gq] but Alzheimer’s disease as well. © [38y  no q just citation bar] Increased concentrations in the brain may promote cellular damage, causing nerve cell dysfunction and degeneration, and could contribute to neuroinflammation and the formation of amyloid plaques. © [36] You can show the boost in inflammatory gene © [f1] right in a petri dish. You grow human nerve cells in vitro and © [f3] drip a little cholesterol on and you can get a © [move in red bars] bump in inflammation, but add the same amount of © [move in black bars] oxidized cholesterol and it gets much worse. © [38] And if you look at the changes in brain oxysterols at different stages of Alzheimer's disease on autopsy © [38f2] yu can see how the three main cholesterol oxidation products appear to be building up. © [40gq] Levels have been shown to dramatically increase in Alzheimer's disease brains, adding to the evidence that © [42] oxidized cholesterol may be the driving force behind the development of Alzheimer’s disease.
